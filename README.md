# SQL_Customer_Support_System

"Oracle SQL Code for Customer Support System," is a practical demonstration of designing, implementing, and querying a relational database for managing customer support issues. It's built using Oracle SQL and is structured to be an excellent portfolio piece for showcasing your database skills.



Here's a breakdown of what the project is all about:

Database Schema Design (DDL - Data Definition Language):

The core of the project involves creating a well-structured relational database schema. It's designed with five normalized tables to store information efficiently and avoid data redundancy:
CUSTOMERS: Stores unique details about each customer (ID, name, contact info).
SUPPORT_AGENTS: Holds information about the support personnel (ID, name, email, hire date).
ISSUE_CATEGORIES: Defines standardized categories for support issues (e.g., 'Technical Support', 'Billing Inquiry').
ISSUES: The central table that records individual customer issues, linking to customers, agents (if assigned), and issue categories. It tracks status, priority, and timestamps.
RESOLUTIONS: Stores details about how a specific issue was resolved, including the resolution date, details, and type.
It meticulously uses primary keys (for unique identification of records), foreign keys (to establish relationships between tables and enforce referential integrity), and various constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK) to ensure data validity and consistency.
The use of NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY for IDs demonstrates modern Oracle practices for auto-incrementing primary keys.
Includes comments on tables and columns for clear documentation.
Data Population (DML - Data Manipulation Language):

The project populates the created tables with over 20 realistic datasets. This sample data simulates real-world customer support interactions, allowing for meaningful queries and analysis.
It uses INSERT INTO statements with TO_DATE and TO_TIMESTAMP functions to correctly input date and time information.



Analytical and Reporting Capabilities (Advanced SQL):

This is where the project goes beyond basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to demonstrate advanced SQL skills.
Views:
AGENT_PERFORMANCE_VIEW: This view is designed to provide quick insights into agent efficiency, showing the number of issues handled, resolved, and the average resolution time. It uses complex JOINs, COUNT, AVG, and CASE statements.
OPEN_ISSUES_SUMMARY_VIEW: This view summarizes open issues by category and priority, helping management quickly identify areas requiring attention.
Stored Procedure (PL/SQL):
ASSIGN_ISSUE_TO_AGENT: This PL/SQL procedure demonstrates how to encapsulate business logic. It allows for the safe and controlled assignment of an open issue to a support agent, including robust error handling (e.g., if the issue doesn't exist or is already resolved). This showcases procedural programming within SQL.
Diverse Analytical Queries: A collection of 8 distinct SELECT queries showcasing various SQL constructs:
Retrieving all issues for a specific customer.
Identifying the most common issue categories.
Listing high-priority open issues.
Calculating average resolution times for specific issue types.
Finding customers who have reported multiple issues.
Identifying issues that have been open for an extended period.
Analyzing the distribution of resolution types.
Listing issues resolved by a particular agent.



Overall Purpose and Value for a Resume:

This project is a comprehensive SQL portfolio piece designed to impress potential employers by demonstrating:

Strong foundational knowledge in relational database design and normalization.
Proficiency in Oracle SQL DDL and DML.
Ability to write complex analytical queries using JOINs, aggregation functions, and filtering.
Experience with advanced database features like views and stored procedures (PL/SQL).
Understanding of data integrity, consistency, and error handling.
Problem-solving skills by extracting meaningful insights from data relevant to a business scenario (customer support).
It shows you can not only build a database but also extract valuable business intelligence from it, which is highly sought after in data-related roles.
